Chisel IP Contributions
=======================

If you are here you are hopefully considering contributing some useful chisel modules to
the community. This is the place to do it.

### Using ip-contributions

```ip-contributions``` is published with Maven central and to use it simply add following
line to your ```build.sbt```

```
libraryDependencies += "edu.berkeley.cs" % "ip-contributions" % "0.5.2"

```

### Getting Started

To begin with you should have some working Chisel code.
Adding it is designed to be as simple as possible.
There are two main ways to go about this.
1. Creating a new package here in the src/main/scala and src/test/scala and place your circuit and it's unit tests in those respective directories. [More about this](more-on-locally-provided-contributions)
1. Create an external repository and distribute it via the [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/), let us review it and provides links to it.

### External Contributions

---

#### aes_chisel
- **Developer** Sergiu Mosanu
- **Repository** [https://github.com/hplp/aes_chisel](https://github.com/hplp/aes_chisel)
- **Versions** 3.2, 3.1
- **Sbt Dependency** com.github.hplp" %% "aes_chisel" % "3.2.0"

**aes_chisel**'s goals are to:
* Implement an open-source, transparent, secure encryption module in Chisel
* Equip developers with ready-to-use, efficient, parameterizable, encryption macros for RISC-V systems
* Compare performance and resource utilization of generated HDL with pure Verilog and Vivado HLS
* Compare code size with Verilog, Python, C++ and Vivado HLS as a index of development productivity

#### spi2wb
- **Developer** Fabien Marteau
- **Repository** [https://github.com/Martoni/spi2wb](https://github.com/Martoni/spi2wb)
- **Versions** 1.3, 1.2, 1.1, 1.0
- **Sbt Dependency** com.github.hplp" %% "spi2wb" % "1.3"

**spi2wb**'s goals are to:
* Drive a wishbone master bus with SPI
* Be easy to integrate in little FPGA
* Be used with simple computer and USB tools like BusPirate
* Avoid usage of softcore under the FPGA to drive wishbone peripherals

### The Requirements

- Code Style should reasonably follow the default style guide used by the Chisel3 project. See [the chisel3 scalastyle-config](https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel3/blob/master/scalastyle-config.xml)
- Unit Tests should be provided that reasonable confidence that a contribution works
- Useful README.md should be added in your package directory with contribution specific info.
- Licensing this code is still a  **WIP**
